## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This repository presents a **Bayesian optimization framework** for guiding the **sputter deposition of molybdenum thin films**, targeting optimal **residual stress** and **sheet resistance**, while minimizing sensitivity to stochastic process variations.
Key deposition parameters â€” **power**, **pressure**, and **working distance** â€” influence these properties.
We apply **Bayesian optimization** to efficiently search the process space using a **custom objective function** that incorporates:

- Empirical stress and resistance data
- Prior knowledge about pressure-dependent variability

### âœ… Key Features

- Rapid identification of optimal deposition parameters
- Improved consistency and reproducibility of thin film properties
- Reduced experimental effort

Our results confirm that Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for thin film process development, delivering high-performance films with controlled stress and resistance characteristics.
